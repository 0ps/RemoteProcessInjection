# RemoteProcessInjection

C# remote process injection utility for Cobalt Strike. The idea is to perform process injection without spawning Powershell and also use a custom obfuscated shellcode payload.

# Usage

Within a beacon it can be executed using the following command.

```
execute-assembly /path/RemoteInject.exe PID eW91cnNoZWxsY29kZQo=
```
